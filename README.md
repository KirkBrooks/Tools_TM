Collection of generic methods  
As I often needs these methods in various applications I placed them in a component  

Historic note:
previous versions included much more methods, such as HTTP_Download or File name/path/extension routines, which are now obsolete as included in 4D.


Note: project requires 4D v17 R5 or newer.
Included binary build is compiled with v17 R6, requires recompilation to be useable with R5
