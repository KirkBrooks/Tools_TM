Collection of generic methods  
As I often needs these methods in various applications I placed them in a component  

Historic note:
previous versions included much more methods, such as HTTP_Download or File name/path/extension routines, which are now obsolete as included in 4D.


Note: this files are exported using 4D v17 R3 Export structure file (http://doc.4d.com/4Dv17R3/4D/17-R3/Export-structure-file.301-3965587.en.html)
This is export only, you cannot directly import them.
The export still allows to track difference between versions, allowing customers using a copy of these components to follow changes. And it allows me to have one global version, avoiding to have several copies with different code changes on my different computers...
