## Tools_TM

Collection of generic methods.  
As I often needs these methods in various applications I placed them in a component  

Documentation for methods see [Methods.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ThomasMaul/Tools_TM_export/blob/master/Methods.html)

### Historic note

Previous versions included much more methods, such as `HTTP_Download` or File name/path/extension routines, which are now obsolete as included in 4D.

### Note

* Project requires 4D v17 R5 or newer.
* Included binary build is compiled with v17 R6, requires recompilation to be useable with R5
